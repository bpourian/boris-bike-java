### Boris-Bike TDD in Java

The aim of this application is to represent a real life interaction with the London hire bicycles famously known as `Boris Bikes`.

This was useful for me to make as it allowed me to better understand JUnit5 testing API and the use of Mockito library for mocking and classes.

I developed the application through the use of TDD.

```
As a user,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a user,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a systemadmin, 
So that my docking station only takes in a set number of bikes,
I'd like to set a limite and inform the user that docking station is full
